Module  : Signature Restrictions
Version : 1.0.2
Author  : Maurice Makaay

This module implements configurable features for enforcing signature
restrictions. The module will check the signature when it is stored
in the control center by the user and show an error to the user if
the new signature does not meet the restrictions.

Available restrictions are:

 - The maximum number of characters;
 - The maximum number of lines;
 - The maximum number of characters for a single line;
 - An option to disable the use of images;
 - An option to disable any kind of markup, possibly until
   the user has been signed up long enough.


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "signature_restrictions" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Signature Restrictions".

- Edit the settings for the module to setup the restrictions that
  you want to use for your Phorum installation.


Customization:
--------------

You can translate the error messages that this module produces by writing a
language file "mods/signature_restrictions/lang/<yourlang>.php".
In this filename <yourlang> has to be the same name as the main language
file that you use (i.e. "include/lang/<yourlang>.php"). If you write a
translation for this module, then please post it in the module's thread
at phorum.org, so I can include it in the distribution.

If you want to inform your users about signature restrictions before they
submit the signature editing form, then you can edit the cc_usersettings.tpl
template file to include the information. This file contains multiple
control panels. The one that you have to edit, starts with the template code
{IF PROFILE->SIGSETTINGS}
